# Rules

## Objective of the Game

In this game, you are a transit operator, driving your bus around the City of Vancouver. You score  victory points by picking up and delivering passengers to their destinations. When a player has delivered their 16th passenger, the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins the game.

## Setting up

1. Place the game board on a flat surface.
2. Open the 8 containers of passenger tokens, and line them up in numerical order (from 1 to 8) near the game board.
3. Shuffle each of the 8 passenger decks. Place these decks next to their corresponding passenger token container. Be sure to leave enough room for a discard pile next to each passenger card deck.
4. Shuffle the upgrade deck. Reveal the first three cards and place them face-up next to the deck.
